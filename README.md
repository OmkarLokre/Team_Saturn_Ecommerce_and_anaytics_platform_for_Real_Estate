## Introduction

This SQL script serves as a comprehensive solution for property management, including functionalities such as property listing, user management, NOC (No Objection Certificate) issuance, data aggregation, transaction management, and more.

## Database Structure

The script creates the following tables:

- `property`: Stores information about properties including location, size, price, and listing date.
- `user`: Manages user data such as name, contact number, email, and associated property ID.
- `NOC`: Tracks NOC status for each property.
- `type`: Specifies the type of each property (e.g., residential or commercial).

## Usage

1. **Database Creation**: Execute the script to create the `case_study` database.
2. **Table Definitions**: Define tables including `property`, `user`, `NOC`, and `type`.
3. **Data Insertion**: Insert sample data into the tables.
4. **Privileges**: Create roles and users, grant appropriate privileges.
5. **Transaction Management**: Manage transactions using `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `SAVEPOINT`.
6. **Data Aggregation**: Perform aggregation operations like `COUNT`, `AVG`, `SUM`, etc.
7. **Joins**: Utilize `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN` for data retrieval.
8. **Views**: Create views for simplified data access.
9. **Triggers**: Define triggers for enforcing data integrity and validation rules.

## Features

- Comprehensive database schema for property management.
- Transaction management for data consistency.
- User roles and privileges management.
- Data aggregation for reporting and analysis.
- Views for simplified data access.
- Triggers for enforcing business rules and constraints.

## Transaction Management

The script demonstrates transaction management using `SET AUTOCOMMIT`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `SAVEPOINT`.

## Data Aggregation

Data aggregation operations include `COUNT`, `AVG`, `SUM`, and `GROUP BY` clauses for analyzing property data.

## Joins

Both `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN` are utilized to combine data from multiple tables.

## Views

Views are created to simplify data access and encapsulate complex queries.

## Triggers

Triggers are defined for enforcing business rules and data integrity constraints.
